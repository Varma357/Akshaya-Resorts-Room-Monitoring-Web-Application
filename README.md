## 📌 Project Overview
**Akshaya Resorts – Room Monitor** is a front-end web application designed to digitally monitor and manage room-related work in hotels and resorts.  
The system replaces manual registers with an interactive dashboard that tracks **Pending**, **Partial**, and **Completed** room tasks efficiently.

This project is developed as an **academic & portfolio project**, showcasing practical usage of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with real-world hospitality use cases.
